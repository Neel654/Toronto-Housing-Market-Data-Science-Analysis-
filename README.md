# Toronto-Housing-Market-Data-Science-Analysis

A comprehensive data science project focused on analyzing and modeling housing trends in the **Toronto real estate market**. This project leverages Python and key machine learning libraries to generate insights, visualize patterns, and predict property prices.

## 📊 Overview
This analysis simulates a real-world housing dataset with 1,000+ synthetic property listings to avoid privacy concerns, while still reflecting realistic market behaviors. It includes:

- Data wrangling and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of trends and distributions
- Predictive modeling with regression algorithms
- Model evaluation and insight communication

## 📈 Machine Learning Models

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

Each model was trained on the simulated dataset and evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R² score to assess prediction accuracy.

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified key pricing factors such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
- Visualized correlations between variables to guide model feature selection.
- Developed accurate, explainable models for estimating house prices.
